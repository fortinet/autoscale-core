The Fortinet Autoscale project provides cloud-based multi-group auto scaling functionality for virtual machines of Fortinet products that have native HA features to form a cluster with failover protection.

This project has the following features:

* Multi-group licensing models: Bring Your Own License (BYOL)-Only, Pay As You Go (PAYG)-Only, and Hybrid (any combination of BYOL and PAYG).
* AWS Transit Gateway integration (see: [https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-aws](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-aws))
